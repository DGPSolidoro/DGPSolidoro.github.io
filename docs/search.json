    "text": "Welcome!\nI am currently pursuing a degree in International Affairs with a minor in Business Administration at John Cabot University in Rome, and I expect to graduate in 2026.\nMy passion for global affairs began early in life during my time abroad as a military family child on a NATO base. There, I significantly improved my English skills, officially assessed at Level 5 (native speaker level) by DoDEA. That formative experience sparked my deep interest in international relations and the work of global organizations that promote trust and security around the world.\nIn 2023, I graduated from an Italian Linguistic Liceo with top honors (100/100), having studied four languages: Italian, English, Spanish, and French. I am also currently a beginner student of Russian.\nAt JCU, I have taken a wide range of courses that combine global issues with technical skills. One highlight was Computational Methods for the Social Sciences, where I learned programming, data analysis, and data visualization using tools such as R and Python. In this course, I conducted an independent research project that applied these skills to global political topics. You can explore my report and presentation in the Portfolio section.\nPlease feel free to also check out my Curriculum Vitae for more details on my background and working experiences."
